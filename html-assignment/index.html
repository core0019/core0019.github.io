        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <em>Daniel Correll</em>, I usually go by Dan but I am easy in that regard!
            I have recently graduated from the Library and Information Technician program here at the college as a mature student, 
            and was looking to gain more knowledge in area's that I thought were seriously lacking in the library world and that would allow me to be creative in a professional setting. 
            I have always had a fascination withÂ  art and design, and was so happy to find a program which would allow me to explore 
            that while allowing me to continue to grow my professional skill set.
         </p>
         <p>
             Previous to the completion of my diploma I had been working in the Library of the <abbr title="Supreme Court of Canada">SCC</abbr> as a Technical Service Assistant on a year-long contract. 
             I very much look forward to my 1<sup>st</sup> semester in the Interactive media management program!
