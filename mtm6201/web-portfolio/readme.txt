For my web portfolio I decided to use a mix of Grid and Flex layouts as 
I wanted to become more comfortable with using them. The challenges I faced mostly had to do with
the responsivness of my header and footer. I overcame these challenges by simplying my approach and cleaning up 
my code. I find that this is where I usually get stumped, because I over-complicate things.I felt the biggest thing
I learned about by doing this assignment is how to better look through resources to find solutions, 
as before this it could take up most of my time because I didn't know how to phrase what I wanted exactly, 
where's now I feel alot more confident in knowing the correct terminology to look for.
